  The project is divided into four teams: Mechanical, Electrical, Software, and Business. As most of the work is monodisciplinary, the teams work independently during the Fall quarter on their respective portions, coming together in the Winter and Spring quarters to combine the results, make adjustments, and focus on cross-disciplinary aspects. Biweekly general meetings are forums for all members to ask questions and plan designs around the needs of other teams.

  The Mechanical Team works on the physical design and construction of the submarine. The entire submarine is modeled in Solidworks, with small subgroups designing and modeling additional components. As the competition objectives change annually, the base submarine is reused with competition-specific parts added. The division of work into many small groups allows everyone involved to contribute greatly to the project.

  The Electrical Team designs the electronic circuitry and manages electrical components. With custom PCBs and a variety of interconnected parts, they extensively apply their coursework knowledge to manage power, heat dipersion, and a large number of components working asynchronously.

  The Software Team develops the artificial intelligence portion of the submarine, connecting the mechanical and electrical components to give the submarine life. They use Robotic Operating System, a robot-centric operating system built on Ubuntu (and a standard in industry) for management of the submarine's processes and state machines. The software team creates the algorithms to identify objectives, control the submarine, and accomplish the tasks.

  The Business Team works to secure fundraising and sponsorship for the project, managing communication and outreach, creating promotional gear for our members and sponsors, and searching for corporate partnerships.
