The annual RoboSub competition is held at the US Navy's TRANSDEC Terminal in San Diego. RoboSub challenges teams to build an autonomous submarine
 capable of completing a number of tasks without any human contact or communication. Points are awarded primarily by the submarine's abilities, with
 padding by weight, dimensions, design, presentation, technical documentation,
and completion time. For the competition we turn on the submarine, place it in the water, and watch it go!

UCR competes annually with the second version of our submarine, the "Seadragon". The competition is a weeklong event in late July/early August. We bring as many teammembers as financially possible!
<br><br>
RoboNation, RoboSub's parent organization, releases the season's themes and objectives late Fall Quarter, with updates as the year progresses. During Fall Quarter we orient new members
 with the RoboSub competition and the Seadragon through various workshops and training. Winter Quarter we design and construct needed systems, and begin water testing. Spring Quarter
 we continue water testing and prepare for the competition. Summer months are used to make final adjustments, tunings, and complete technical documentation.
