Each year we create a completely autonomous submarine capable of performing a number of tasks entirely on its own: we place it in the water, it searches for and completes objectives, and returns to a surface point. The sheer volume of design and construction needed requires a large interdisciplinary team working collaboratively to share expertise and communication throughout the process.
<br><br>
The project exposes all students to utilizing their coursework skills, working with others outside their major, learning material not taught in lectures, and granting extensive engineering experience with a large-scale project with real-world applications. For the 2017-2018 year, UCR Robosub had ~20 members on the team, across almost every engineering major, and several non-engineers.
